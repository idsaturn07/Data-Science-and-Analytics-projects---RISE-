### Project 1: Sales Forecasting with Linear Regression

**Problem Statement:**  
Businesses struggle to estimate future sales based on past performance.

**Objective:**  
Build a regression model to predict future sales using historical data.

**Key Features:**
- CSV input with `date`, `product`, `quantity`, and `revenue`
- Null value handling and preprocessing
- Applied Linear Regression for prediction
- Visualized actual vs predicted sales and future forecast

**Output:**
- Line chart of actual/predicted/forecasted revenue
- `30_day_forecast.csv` with future sales data

### Project 2: Student Performance Analytics Dashboard

**Problem Statement:**  
Institutions need early warnings for students who might fail or drop out.

**Objective:**  
Analyze student data to highlight performance trends and risk areas.

**Key Features:**
- Dataset with `marks`, `attendance`, and `logins`
- Calculated correlations and absenteeism impact
- Visualizations: heatmap, bar chart, and scatterplot

**Output:**
- Performance categories (Top Performer vs Struggling)
- `performance_summary.csv`

### Project 3: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means

**Problem Statement:**  
Businesses need to target different customers differently based on behavior.

**Objective:**  
Cluster customers into groups using unsupervised learning.

**Key Features:**
- Used K-Means clustering with features like `age`, `income`, `frequency`, `spending`
- Data scaling with StandardScaler
- 2D and 3D PCA-based cluster visualizations

**Output:**
- Cluster-labeled customer dataset
- 2D & 3D cluster plots (.png)

### Project 4: COVID-19 Data Analysis

**Problem Statement:**  
Understanding COVID-19 trends helps in planning public health policies.

**Objective:**  
Analyze global COVID-19 data to visualize trends and compare countries.

**Key Features:**
- Cleaned and grouped data (confirmed, recovered, deaths)
- Visualized using line charts, area plots, and heatmaps

**Output:**
- Global case trend charts
- Top countries visual breakdown

### Project 5: E-Commerce Data Insights

**Problem Statement:**  
E-commerce platforms need to know what products and users drive revenue.

**Objective:**  
Explore sales and user data to derive business insights.

**Key Features:**
- Product performance analysis
- Top users, purchase timing, review scores
- Bar, pie, and line charts

**Output:**
- Product and user behavior dashboards (.png)

### Project 6: Netflix User Behavior Analysis

**Problem Statement:**  
Streaming services want to understand what content users prefer.

**Objective:**  
Analyze Netflix viewing data to identify genre and user trends.

**Key Features:**
- Watch time per genre and user
- Average rating by genre
- Daily viewing trend visualization

**Output:**
- Genre-based insights
- Binge-watching behavior analysis

---

### Project 7: Traffic Pattern Analysis

**Problem Statement:**  
Cities face congestion due to poor traffic pattern understanding.

**Objective:**  
Use vehicle data to find peak traffic periods and detect anomalies.

**Key Features:**
- Generated synthetic hourly traffic data
- Plotted daily traffic volumes
- Anomaly detection using Z-scores

**Output:**
- Time-series traffic visualization
- Anomaly count printout and analysis

---

### Project 8: Survey Data Visualization

**Problem Statement:**  
Survey results are often under-utilized due to poor analysis.

**Objective:**  
Create informative visual summaries using survey data.

**Key Features:**
- Dataset with categorical and rating fields
- Pie charts, bar charts, and heatmaps
- Feature importance ratings

**Output:**
- Visual dashboard (.png files)
- Insights on satisfaction and preferences
